# Dibba tree
This is an simple tree data structure for javascript.

Create the tree instance by simply requiring the dibba_tree module and create a
new instance of the object.

Then you can use the insert, update and/or delete methods to modify the  
of the tree.

The first argument to the insert and update methods is the new content for the node.

The update method supports undefined and null as content whilst the insert
method strictly forbids this.

## Why Dibba
Dibba is a town on the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates. I got the idea
 of writing this module during a vacation there in the winter of 2017.
